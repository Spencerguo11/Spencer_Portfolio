# [Project 3: Geographic Analysis: Overview](https://rpubs.com/Spencer_Guo/1229079)
* Conducted a spatial analysis to assess heat-related mortality risks across 1487 census block groups in Houston.
* Applied Moran's I test and spatial generalized linear models (GLMs) to identify the most vulnerable populations based on factors like age, poverty, and access to air conditioning.
* Found that areas outside central Houston showed higher unexplained risks, suggesting the need for targeted interventions.
